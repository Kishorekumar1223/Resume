        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a recent graduate in the field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering,
            I am equipped with a solid foundation in the principles of algorithm design. 
            This foundation has been further strengthened by my passion for software development, 
            a field that I find both challenging and rewarding. My interest lies particularly in full-stack development.

        <P>My proficiency in Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language, 
            further enhances my ability to contribute effectively to a software development team. I am confident in my ability to write clean, 
            efficient code that adheres to best practices and design principles. </P>

            In the fast-paced, ever-evolving world of software development, and to contribute to the development of applications that meet user needs and exceed their expectations.
             Whether it is designing an intuitive user interface on the front-end or optimizing server logic on the back-end, I am ready and eager to make a meaningful contribution.
        </p>
